distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors scheduler jobs configured in ORACLE
 databases. It monitors all jobs wether or not their last
 execution was successfull and the next execution is
 scheduled. It also records the execution time of the jobs.

 The new item format is required for jobs with same name at
 different users.

 This check needs the Check_MK {mk_oracle}-plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 There are 2 different formats:
 new format: <SID>.<JOB_OWNER>.<JOB_NAME>
 old format: <SID>.<JOB_NAME>

 The old item format is for backword compatibility. A new
 inventory automatically creates services in new format!

perfdata:
 One value: the duration of the last job execution in seconds.


[parameters]
parameters (dict):

 {"disabled"}: Either {True} (default) or {False} - Ignore the state of
 the job. {True} => a disabled job is OK

 {"run_duration"}:  By default a tuple containing the warn and crit levels
 for the run_duration of the job. A value of 0 ignores the warn or crit state.

inventory:
 One separate check for each enabled job will be created.
 An inventory always creates jobs with the new agent item format
