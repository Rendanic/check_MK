description:
 Checks usage of ORACLE ASM Disk Groups and Offline Disk.

 Make sure you have installed the mk_oracle or mk_oracle_asm agent 
 plugin on the monitored machines.

 The check goes 'stale' when no data is found for the Disk Group.
 If a Disk Group is not mounted the check goes in stale state.
 There is no way to get more details for a broken Disk Group with SQL
 so you need to look in the alert.log of the ASM-Instance.

 Please monitor the service for the diskgroup in Grid-Infrastructure.

 See also check manpage for df. All the configuration from there can
 also be used for ORACLE ASM Disk Groups.

 An additional option is availible:
 Normaly the check calculates the free space from free_mb column.
 The parameter req_mirror_free could be used to change this to
 Req_mir_free_MB for NORMAL or HIGH redundancy Disk Groups.

 The old parameter filesystem_default_levels is replaced with
 asm_diskgroup_default_levels. This changed is required to add the
 additional parameter req_mir_free. All other parameters are from
 filesystem_default_levels

item:
 The name of the disk group as delivered by asmcmd.

examples:
 # Set default levels for all filesystems (including ORACLE ASM Disk Groups)
 # to 90/95
 asm_diskgroup_default_levels = (90, 95)

 # more examples in check manpage for df

perfdata:
 see check manpage for df

inventory:
 Creates one check for every disk group in the agent's output.
